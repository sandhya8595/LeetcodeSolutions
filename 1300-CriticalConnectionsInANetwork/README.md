# 1192. Critical Connections in a Network

**Difficulty:** Hard  
[View on LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/critical-connections-in-a-network/)

---

There are `n` servers numbered from `0` to `n - 1` connected by undirected server-to-server `connections` forming a network where `connections[i] = [a_i, b_i]` represents a connection between servers `a_i` and `b_i`. Any server can reach other servers directly or indirectly through the network.

A *critical connection* is a connection that, if removed, will make some servers unable to reach some other server.

Return all critical connections in the network in any order.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 4, connections = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,0],[1,3]]
Output: [[1,3]]
Explanation: [[3,1]] is also accepted.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 2, connections = [[0,1]]
Output: [[0,1]]
```

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= n <= 10^5`
- `n - 1 <= connections.length <= 10^5`
- `0 <= a_i, b_i <= n - 1`
- `a_i != b_i`
- There are no repeated connections.
